<h1>Open Legal Questions</h1>
  <p>  
    This will be the website for the <i>Open Legal Questions</i> project.
    The aim of the website is to collate and explain open legal questions. 
    The goal is to help practising lawyers to notice when an open issue arises and how it might best be argued.
    The further goal is to resolve these problems in the courts.
  </p>
  <p>  
    I aim to launch in 2025, focusing on English criminal law.

    This project is run by <a href="www.jamesmanwaring.com">James Manwaring</a> (University of Cambridge).
